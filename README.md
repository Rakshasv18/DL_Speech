# Flawless_assignment

Project Overview

This repository contains two separate deep learning projects, each organized into its own folder. Both projects involve training and evaluating neural networks, and each folder includes the necessary files to run the respective models.

Question_01\
This folder contains all files related to the first deep learning model.

Question_01.readme: Detailed documentation of the first project, including model architecture, data used, and training methodology.

Question_02\
This folder contains files related to the second deep learning model, focused on solving the MNIST classification problem using a custom multi-layer perceptron.

Question_02.readme: Detailed documentation of the second project, including model architecture, data used, and training methodology.


Environment Setup\
To set up the environment required for both projects, use the environment.yaml file included in the repository. This file contains all the dependencies and versions required to run the code.

To create the environment, run the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml

```

Once the environment is created, activate it using:

```bash

conda activate <environment_name>

```

Replace <environment_name> with the name of the environment specified in environment.yaml.
